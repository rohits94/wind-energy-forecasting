# wind-energy-forecasting

Time series analysis and hourly forecasts for German wind energy production. Preliminary data formatting in Python, exploratory analysis and forecasting in R.

**Note:** I worked on this project with a classmate. I was primarily responsible for EDA on the **hourly series**, including visualizations, outlier inspection, ACF/PACF, periodograms, and cross-correlation plots.
